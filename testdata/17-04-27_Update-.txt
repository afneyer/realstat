6031 Camden Street |Oakland, CA  94605|
April 5, 2017|
Dear Friends,|
Since its inception, Partnership for Affordable Housing (PAH) has been able to provide temporary living |accommodations for individuals and families transitioning from homelessness to self-sufficiency. Our |facility has experienced great success; to date, our housing placement since 2015 has been 90% with |individuals finding housing in Oakland and throughout the surrounding area.|
After seven years at 6031 Camden Street, Oakland, CA, we received devastating news: our transitional |house has been sold and we need to vacate the premises in 30 days. |
This action caught us off guard and places us in a problematic situation. We see ourselves as a beacon in |the Oakland community; a place that people in desperate personal situations can turn to for assistance not |only with interim housing, but also receive education and coaching in the areas of life skills enhancement |and health and wellness. Our residents have participated in workshops and activities for our residents in |the areas of gardening, mentoring children, meditation, nutrition/cooking, conflict resolution, how to find |housing, opening a checking/savings account, and mental health services.|
We desperately need your help securing a building or a very large facility that can house 3 preschool-aged |children along with 10 adult women. If you have knowledge of or access to a property that can |accommodate us, we certainly would appreciate any assistance you can offer at this critical time.|
It is my prayer that the above-mentioned services will continue to be provided; any contacts that you may |have would be a help and a blessing to our organization and the families we serve.|
With a heartfelt Thank You,|
Diane L. Burr|Executive Director|Partnership for Affordable Housing|510-912-1513
